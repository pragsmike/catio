Tools are implemented in Clojure and Haskell.
This is mostly to explore ways of interoperating,
than for any good technical reason.

Unix pipes between compiled programs seems like a good first solution to
try.

The model readers, written in Clojure, naturally emit the model in EDN
format. Clojure programs will naturally just read that.

To read EDN in Haskell, use [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedn][hedn]].

* Error building on Ubuntu 18.04

#+begin_src sh
AesonException "Error in $.packages.cassava.constraints.flags['bytestring--lt-0_10_4']: Invalid flag name: \"bytestring--lt-0_10_4\""
#+end_src

Had the same problem. This worked

1. uninstalling haskell-cabal with apt

2. installing it agains with curl

    curl -sSL https://get.haskellstack.org/ | sh

as it is recommended (https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/#how-to-install)

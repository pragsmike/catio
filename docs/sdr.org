LuaRadio has zero dependencies for non-real-time applications, and may otherwise
use liquid-dsp or VOLK for acceleration in real-time applications. liquid-dsp
shares LuaRadioâ€™s affinity for minimal dependencies and making software-defined
radio more accessible to embedded Linux platforms.

[[https://github.com/jgaeddert/liquid-dsp][liquid-dsp]] liquid-dsp is a free and open-source digital signal processing (DSP)
library designed specifically for software-defined radios on embedded platforms.
The aim is to provide a lightweight DSP library that does not rely on a myriad
of external dependencies or proprietary and otherwise cumbersome frameworks. All
signal processing elements are designed to be flexible, scalable, and dynamic,
including filters, filter design, oscillators, modems, synchronizers, complex
mathematical operations, and much more.

The SoapySDR project is an open-source generalized API and runtime library for
interfacing with SDR devices. With SoapySDR, you can instantiate, configure, and
stream with an SDR device in a variety of environments. Most off the shelf SDR
hardware platforms are supported by SoapySDR, and many open source applications
rely on SoapySDR for hardware integration support. In additon, SoapySDR has
bindings for development frameworks like GNU Radio and Pothos.

 The Pothos project is a complete data-flow framework for creating topologies of
 interconnected processing blocks. Topologies can be designed and tested
 graphically, and deployed over a network. The Pothos framework API enables
 users to quickly create custom processing blocks with minimal boiler-plate.
 Processing blocks can support computational offload and integration with SoC
 and DMA devices. The project also has a diverse set of processing and hardware
 support toolkits.

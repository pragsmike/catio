Tools are implemented in Clojure and Haskell.
This is mostly to explore ways of interoperating,
than for any good technical reason.

Unix pipes between compiled programs seems like a good first solution to
try.

The model readers, written in Clojure, naturally emit the model in EDN
format. Clojure programs will naturally just read that.

To read EDN in Haskell, use [[http://hackage.haskell.org/package/hedn][hedn]].

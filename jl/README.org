#+TITLE: Spanner: channel recognizer

Experiments with Julia for signal processing.

Currently this is just me trying to learn Julia.

  Installing Julia on (almost any) x86 Linux:
  #+begin_src 
  sudo tar xf julia-1.4.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz -C /usr/local --strip-components=1
  #+end_src

* Spanner algorithm
  
  How to recognize which subbands are channels?

  Probability that a bin belongs to a channel

  Probability that a channel exists that contains the given bin(s)

  Given a time-domain complex sample stream of sampling rate S
  by taking an N-point FFT
  we derive a stream of frequency-domain bin vectors occuring at rate S/N.
  
  We treat each vector of bins as one observation.

  Each bin is related to its nearest neighbors.
  Each bin is related to its past self.

* Channel distortions
  
  The algorithm must perform with these channel degradations:
  
  * There are transient signals at discrete frequencies.
  * Every couple of seconds, there is a very wideband signal that delivers
    energy into all bins for a few tens of milliseconds.

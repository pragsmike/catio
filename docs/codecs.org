#+TITLE: SDR Flowgraph codecs

The codecs read flowgraphs from files into an in-memory representation,
and write that representation to a file.


* GRC files are XML
  
  The first line is
  
#+begin_src xml
<?grc format='1' created='3.7.11'?>
#+end_src

  There is no schema referenced in the document.
  
   * flow_graph
   * block

  I haven't seen one that uses hyperedges.
   
* ptolemy files are XML
  
  These can have hyperedges.  The ptolemy graph editor has
  a "connection" object, rendered as a diamond, that wires
  can connect to.
  
  In ptolemy, wires have structure.  They have a multiplicity,
  how many signals they carry in parallel.
